Some unsorted code, but maybe cool. 🙂

There should be manuals for other projects here for my associates, but I'm lazy and only wrote one (and not all the way through). 😅

---

### 🌟 **miniRT**
Some mini ray tracing (so little that this raycasting works, but it takes a long time). 🖼️

---

Exploration of **multithreading** and **multiprocessing** concepts. 🧵⚙️

### 💻 **minishell**
This project is about creating a simple shell.

Enjoy exploring! 🚀
